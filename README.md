# CIS17C_Assignment_3

In this assignment I created a circular linked list that tracks each task of your daily routine! I did this by implementing a singly linked list, but instead of the last node having a nullptr as its next value, it wraps back aroung to the head creating a circle of tasks. I really enjoyed working on this assignment even though Visual Studio decided it hates me today and would not compile any code I wrote, I still enjoyed working on this type of linked list that was simple to implement.
